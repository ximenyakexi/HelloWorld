## 2 Use Case Descriptions

*For each use case in the use case diagram, this section should contain a description, with the following elements:*

- *Requirements: High-level description of what the use case must allow the user to do.*
- *Pre-conditions: Conditions that must be true before the use case is run.*
- *Post-conditions Conditions that must be true once the use case is run.*
- *Scenarios: Sequence of events that characterize the use case. This part may include multiple scenarios, for normal, alternate, and exceptional event sequences. These scenarios may be expressed as a list of steps in natural language or as sequence diagrams.*
